# dotfiles 🧰

## Description 📝

The repository contains **dotfiles** I use on my **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** box:
- Scripts for installing and configuring utility programs, drivers, and applications
- Operating system customization, namely:
    - Dock customization
    - Desktop customization
    - Nautilus customization
    - Romanian language pack
    - Papirus icon theme
- Alias, MIME types, and environment variables management.

As the repository is feature-/application-centric, the majority of folders contains an `install.sh` that is automatically called when running the main `install.sh` script, from the repository root.

The applications and drivers folder can contain others, such as:
- Custom aliases in `aliases.sh`
- MIME types, that are handled by the current application, in `mimes.txt`
- Other configuration files that are symlinked into their correct location.
