### Application-Specific Files

As the repository is feature-/application-centric, the majority of folders contains an `install.sh` that is automatically called when running the main `install.sh` script, from the repository root.

The applications and drivers folder can contain others, such as:
- Custom aliases in `aliases.sh`
- MIME types, that are handled by the current application, in `mimes.txt`
- Other configuration files that are symlinked into their correct location.
