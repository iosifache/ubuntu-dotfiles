### Stepts Involved

1. Adding the target user to the sudoers
2. Setting up the file system
3. Updating the packages
4. Installing utilities packages (for example, `curl` and `git`)
5. Installing the drivers specific to the current host (identified by hostname)
6. Customizing the operating system by:
    - Gathering all aliases specific to the installed software, from `aliases.sh` files
    - Customizing Dock

### Application-Specific Files

As the repository is feature-/application-centric, the majority of folders contains an `install.sh` that is automatically called when running the main `install.sh` script, from the repository root.

The applications and drivers folder can contain others, such as:
- Custom aliases in `aliases.sh`
- MIME types, that are handled by the current application, in `mimes.txt`
- Other configuration files that are symlinked into their correct location.

### Cheatsheet with Locations of Interest

- `ubuntu-customization/fonts/fonts` for custom fonts
- `ubuntu-customization/ssh-keys` for SSH keys
- `*/aliases.sh` for aliases
- `*/mime.txt` for MIME types

## Guides

### Installation

1. Clone the repository on user's desktop.
2. Add the user to sudoers with `sudo TARGET_USER=<target_user> ./sudoers.sh add`.
3. Run the installation script with `TARGET_USER=<target_user> PROFILE_IMAGE=<profile_image_link> ./install.sh`.
4. Remove the user from sudoers with `sudo TARGET_USER=<target_user> ./sudoers.sh remove`.

### Aliases Regeneration

1. Run the regeneration script with:
    - `regenerate-aliases` if you are the target user, or
    - `sudo TARGET_USER=<target_user> ./regenerate_aliases.sh` if you regenerate the aliases for other user.
